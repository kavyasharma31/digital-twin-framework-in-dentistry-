# 🦷 Digital Twin Framework in Dentistry

This repository contains the implementation of a **Digital Twin (DT) framework** for the dental domain. It combines 3D modeling, data-driven machine learning, and simulation capabilities to support enhanced **dental education, diagnosis, and patient communication**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project aims to build a **modular, interactive digital twin** prototype representing dental anatomy. Using 3D geometry (.stl files), data simulation, and predictive ML models, the system enables:

- Real-time visualization of dental structures
- Simulation of patient-specific dental behavior
- Intelligent decision-making support for dental practitioners

This framework integrates aspects of **geometric modeling**, **augmented reality**, and **predictive analytics**, providing a step toward implementing smart dentistry solutions.

## 🧩 Features

- 🦷 **3D Model Viewer** for dental structures using `.stl` files
- 🔍 **Anomaly Detection** for identifying abnormalities in dental geometry
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** modules for classification, segmentation, and behavior prediction
- 🧪 **Simulation Environment** to visualize treatment outcomes
- 🌐 **Modular Design** allowing future integration with real-time sensors or AR/VR systems
